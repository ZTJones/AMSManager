# AMSManager

This project is used for testing out certain features of AMS, as well as developing large testing environments and fixing a large number of expired streaming locators.
For testing purposes, the streaming locators are set to expire in 5 minutes after being refreshed. That can be configured in the code. 

Use of this software is at your own risk, and all code being moved into a production environment should be vetted before being unleashed on the world. 

To run this project, navigate to project root and use the "node server.js".  Navigate to localhost:3000, open up the console on your browser, and fire away!
